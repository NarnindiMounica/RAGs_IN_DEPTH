Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to bridge the gap between human communication and digital systems. NLP techniques allow machines to process text and speech, making it possible to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, language translation, speech recognition, chatbots, and information retrieval. By breaking down language into components like syntax, semantics, and context, NLP systems can extract meaning and respond intelligently. Modern NLP relies heavily on deep learning models, such as transformers, which power applications like voice assistants, automated customer support, and large-scale text analysis. This technology is central to how humans interact naturally with machines today, making it one of the most impactful areas of AI.
