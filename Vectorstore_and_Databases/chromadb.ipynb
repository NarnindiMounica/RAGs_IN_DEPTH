       "AIMessage(content='AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:\\n\\n1. **Learning**: AI systems can learn from data and improve their performance over time.\\n2. **Reasoning**: AI systems can draw conclusions and make decisions based on the data they have been trained on.\\n3. **Problem-solving**: AI systems can identify and solve problems, often in complex situations.\\n4. **Perception**: AI systems can interpret and understand data from sensors, such as images, speech, and text.\\n\\nThe term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was first coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, a computer scientist and cognitive scientist. Since then, AI has evolved significantly and has been applied in various fields, including:\\n\\n1. **Machine Learning**: AI systems can learn from data and improve their performance over time.\\n2. **Natural Language Processing**: AI systems can understand and generate human language.\\n3. **Computer Vision**: AI systems can interpret and understand visual data from images and videos.\\n4. **Robotics**: AI systems can control and interact with physical devices and robots.\\n\\nThere are several types of AI, including:\\n\\n1. **Narrow or Weak AI**: AI systems designed to perform a specific task, such as image recognition or language translation.\\n2. **General or Strong AI**: AI systems that can perform any intellectual task that a human can, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and learning.\\n3. **Superintelligence**: AI systems that are significantly more intelligent than humans, capable of solving complex problems that are currently unsolvable.\\n\\nThe benefits of AI include:\\n\\n1. **Improved efficiency**: AI can automate tasks, freeing up human time and resources.\\n2. **Increased accuracy**: AI can perform tasks with greater accuracy and speed than humans.\\n3. **Enhanced decision-making**: AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights that humans may miss.\\n\\nHowever, AI also raises concerns about:\\n\\n1. **Job displacement**: AI may automate tasks, potentially displacing human workers.\\n2. **Bias and fairness**: AI systems can perpetuate biases and prejudices if they are trained on biased data.\\n3. **Security**: AI systems can be vulnerable to cyber attacks and data breaches.\\n\\nOverall, AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment. However, it is essential to develop and use AI in a responsible and ethical manner.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 492, 'prompt_tokens': 39, 'total_tokens': 531, 'completion_time': 0.605137701, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.003111596, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.056124904, 'total_time': 0.608249297}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_f757f4b0bf', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019af9d8-bc3e-7400-b7d7-40e1f92f6946-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 39, 'output_tokens': 492, 'total_tokens': 531})"
