Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks to process and learn from complex data. It mimics the way the human brain works by stacking artificial neurons into layers, allowing computers to automatically discover intricate patterns and representations without manual feature engineering. The term �deep� refers to the use of many hidden layers�sometimes hundreds or thousands�that transform input data step by step until a meaningful output is produced. These architectures can be trained in supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised ways, making them highly versatile.

Deep learning has revolutionized fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and autonomous systems. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at image classification, while recurrent and transformer-based networks dominate language tasks. By leveraging vast datasets and powerful GPUs, deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance in tasks ranging from facial recognition to self-driving cars. Its ability to handle unstructured data�like images, audio, and text�sets it apart from traditional machine learning approaches, making deep learning a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence
