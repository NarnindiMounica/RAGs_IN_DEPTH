Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed. It works by feeding large datasets into algorithms that identify patterns and relationships, which can then be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. Unlike traditional programming, where rules must be manually defined, machine learning systems adapt and evolve as they encounter more information. This makes them especially powerful for complex tasks such as image recognition, speech processing, natural language translation, fraud detection, and personalized recommendations. By leveraging techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, machine learning has become a cornerstone of modern technology, powering applications from healthcare diagnostics to self-driving cars
